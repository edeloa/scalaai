# scalaai

Named as such because I lack creativity :(

This app allows users to upload Scala classes or functions to serve as algorithms to solve given problems.
After having submitted their code, users can run it against a specific problem and see how their AI agent does.

This could to be used as a learning platform for people learning how to code in Scala or develop algorithms.

An API [soon] is intended to facilitate the easy creation of problem modules - allowing the community to develop new problems or games for others to write algorithms to solve.


The stack:

Front end:
  Scala.JS (with scalatags and upickle [soon])
  Sass
  Bootstrap
  Websockets

Back end:
  Play on Scala
  Akka
